## Pesky behavior (beware)
**Defense:** Throughout the project, check the dataset's number of entries, 1. total 2. pure numbers 3. character items -though they may look like an ordinary number.

✔ Preformatting.
- Dates: E.g. number "1.1" &rarr; "1.jan" &rarr; "1.jan.21" &rarr; "44197" (datenumber)
- Characters: "1" &rarr; with a hidden character "'1" &rarr; which will not be included in the calculation. Usually due to imported columns of numbers, but the entry was interpreted as a character.
 
✔  Distorted cell relationship, no warning:
